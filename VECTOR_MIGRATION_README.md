# Vector Database Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate from your current Firestore keyword search system to OpenAI's Vector Store with semantic search.

## üìã Overview

**What you'll accomplish:**
- Export your Firestore books to text files optimized for vector embeddings
- Create an OpenAI Vector Store and upload your books
- Set up an OpenAI Assistant that uses your books as knowledge base
- Test the integration to ensure quality responses
- Deploy the new system to production

**Time required:** 4-6 hours (mostly automated)

---

## üîß Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js and Dependencies
Make sure you have all dependencies installed:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file has:
```env
# Existing variables (keep these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...

# Add this
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### 3. OpenAI Account Setup
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Add payment method (Vector Store requires paid account)
4. Generate API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
5. Add to `.env.local` as shown above

---

## üöÄ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Export Books from Firestore

This script reads all books from your Firestore database and exports them as text files optimized for vector embeddings.

```bash
node scripts/1-export-books-to-files.js
```

**What it does:**
- Connects to your Firestore database
- Retrieves all books from the `books` collection
- Formats them as structured text (markdown-style)
- Saves to `./data/books/` directory

**Expected output:**
```
üìö Fetching all books from Firestore...
‚úÖ Found 5 books in Firestore

üìù Exporting books to text files...

‚úÖ cardology-business-guide.txt
   Title: Cardology Business Guide
   Size: 234.56 KB
   Content Type: cardology

‚úÖ Export complete!
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå "No books found": Make sure you have books uploaded to Firestore
- ‚ùå "Firebase error": Check your Firebase credentials in `.env.local`
- ‚ùå "Permission denied": Verify your Firestore security rules allow reading

---

### Step 2: Create Vector Store and Upload Books

This script creates an OpenAI Vector Store and uploads your book files.

```bash
node scripts/2-setup-vector-store.js
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a new Vector Store in your OpenAI account
- Uploads all files from `./data/books/`
- Waits for processing to complete
- Saves configuration to `.vector-store-config.json`

**Expected output:**
```
üì¶ Creating OpenAI Vector Store...
‚úÖ Vector Store created: vs_abc123...

üì§ Uploading 5 files to Vector Store...
‚úÖ Upload complete!
   Total files: 5
   Completed: 5
   Failed: 0

‚úÖ Vector Store setup complete!
üìå Vector Store ID: vs_abc123...
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå "OPENAI_API_KEY not set": Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
- ‚ùå "No book files found": Run Step 1 first
- ‚ùå "Upload failed": Check your OpenAI account has billing enabled

**Cost estimate:**
- 100MB of books = ~$0.30/month storage
- Plus API usage costs ($0.01-0.02 per query)

---

### Step 3: Create OpenAI Assistant

This script creates an Assistant configured to use your Vector Store.

```bash
node scripts/3-create-assistant.js
```

**What it does:**
- Creates an OpenAI Assistant with file search capability
- Links it to your Vector Store
- Configures instructions for cardology coaching
- Runs a test query
- Saves configuration to `.assistant-config.json`

**Expected output:**
```
ü§ñ Creating OpenAI Assistant...
‚úÖ Assistant created successfully!

üìã Assistant Details:
   ID: asst_xyz789...
   Name: MDBC Cardology Business Coach
   Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
   Tools: file_search

üß™ Testing Assistant with sample query...
‚úÖ Test Response:
   The Queen of Hearts is characterized by...
üìö Citations found: 3

‚úÖ Setup Complete!
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå "Vector Store configuration not found": Run Step 2 first
- ‚ùå "No citations found": Check that Vector Store was created correctly
- ‚ùå "Test failed": Review the error message and try again

---

### Step 4: Test the Integration

This script runs comprehensive tests to ensure quality responses.

```bash
node scripts/4-test-integration.js
```

**What it does:**
- Runs 5 different test queries
- Measures response quality and speed
- Checks citation accuracy
- Provides quality assessment

**Expected output:**
```
üß™ Test: Card-specific business strengths
üìù Query: "What are the business strengths of the Queen of Hearts?"
‚úÖ Test PASSED
   Response time: 2,340ms
   Citations: 3
   Keyword match: 5/5 (100%)

üìä Test Summary
‚úÖ Passed: 5/5 (100%)
‚è±Ô∏è  Avg Response Time: 2,450ms
üìö Avg Citations: 2.8
üéØ Avg Keyword Match: 92%

üéâ Excellent! Vector Store integration is working perfectly!
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- ‚ùå "Tests failing": Review the specific failure reasons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  "Low keyword match": May need to refine book content
- ‚ùå "No citations": Assistant not using file search properly

---

### Step 5: Update Your Environment Variables

Add the IDs to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Add these new variables
VECTOR_STORE_ID=vs_abc123...  # From step 2
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_xyz789...  # From step 3
```

---

### Step 6: Deploy New API Route

The new API route is ready to use. You have two options:

#### Option A: Replace existing route (recommended)
```bash
# Backup old route
cp app/api/chat/route.js app/api/chat/route.js.backup

# The new implementation uses the Assistant API
# Review VECTOR_DATABASE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md Phase 3 for the new code
```

#### Option B: Run in parallel for testing
```bash
# Keep old route at /api/chat
# Create new route at /api/chat-v2
# Compare results before full migration
```

---

### Step 7: Update Frontend

Update your chat interface to use the new API:

```javascript
// utils/secureChat.js
export async function sendSecureMessage(message, userData) {
  // Get or create session ID
  let sessionId = localStorage.getItem('chat_session_id');
  if (!sessionId) {
    sessionId = `session-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`;
    localStorage.setItem('chat_session_id', sessionId);
  }

  const response = await fetch('/api/chat-v2', {  // or '/api/chat' if you replaced it
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: message,
      userData: {
        name: userData.name,
        birthCard: userData.birthCard,
        age: userData.age,
        uid: userData.uid
      },
      sessionId: sessionId
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.response;
}
```

## üìä Monitoring and Optimization

### Check OpenAI Dashboard
Monitor usage and costs:
- https://platform.openai.com/usage
- https://platform.openai.com/assistants

### Performance Metrics to Track
- Average response time
- Citation frequency
- User satisfaction ratings
- Cost per query

### Optimization Tips

**1. Reduce costs:**
```javascript
// Use GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4
model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"  // 70% cheaper
```

**2. Implement caching:**
```javascript
// Cache common queries
const cache = new Map();
if (cache.has(query)) {
  return cache.get(query);
}
```

**3. Optimize chunking:**
```javascript
// When exporting books, optimize chunk sizes
// Aim for 500-1000 words per section
```

## üîÑ Updating Book Content

When you need to update your books:

### Method 1: Re-export and re-upload all
```bash
# 1. Update books in Firestore
# 2. Re-export
node scripts/1-export-books-to-files.js

# 3. Upload to existing Vector Store
node scripts/update-vector-store.js  # (to be created if needed)
```

### Method 2: Update individual files
```bash
# Upload a single updated file
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/vector_stores/vs_abc/files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F file=@./data/books/updated-book.txt
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: High costs
**Solution:** 
- Switch to GPT-3.5-turbo
- Implement response caching
- Set up rate limiting
- Monitor usage dashboard

### Issue: Low quality responses
**Solution:**
- Review and improve book content formatting
- Refine Assistant instructions
- Increase temperature for more creative responses
- Add more context in queries

### Issue: Slow responses
**Solution:**
- Check OpenAI status page
- Reduce max_tokens in API calls
- Implement loading states in UI
- Consider parallel API calls for batch queries

### Issue: No citations in responses
**Solution:**
- Verify Vector Store is linked to Assistant
- Check that files were uploaded successfully
- Review Assistant instructions
- Test with more specific queries
