## 🤖 ChatGPT Instructions Added

```
=== CARD NAMING CONVENTIONS ===
ALWAYS use these card names when responding:
- "Development" (NOT "Displacement") - This is the Development card
- "Support" (NOT "Environment") - This is the Support card
- Pluto and Result cards are ALWAYS interpreted as a pair - 
  best to know both cards for full interpretation

When the user's data shows "Displacement" or "Environment", 
translate to "Development" and "Support" in your responses.
```

---

## ✅ Backward Compatibility

**Old terminology still works:**
- ✅ User asks "What is my Displacement card?" → System understands
- ✅ User asks "What is my Environment card?" → System understands
- ✅ Data still stores as `Displacement` and `Environment` internally
- ✅ Only the **display names** and **user-facing language** changed

---

1. ✅ "What are my yearly cards?"
