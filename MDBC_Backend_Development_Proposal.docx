Million Dollar Birth Card (MDBC) Backend Development Proposal

Project Overview
Client: Robert Dawson
Project: MDBC Backend Architecture Development
Rate: $50/hour
Total Estimated Cost: $4,000
Timeline: 6-7 weeks

Current State Analysis

Frontend Implementation Complete ✅
• React/Next.js application with card lookup functionality
• CSV-based data system for birth cards, forecasts, and planetary periods
• Enhanced card system with modal displays
• Local storage for profiles and conversations
• Chat interface (currently simulated)
• Professional UI with Tailwind CSS

Backend Requirements 🔄
Transform the current local-storage-based app into a full SaaS platform with:
• User authentication and management
• Payment processing and subscriptions
• Referral system with automated rewards
• Email notifications
• Production-ready deployment

Backend Architecture Overview

Core Components

1. Frontend (User Facing Layer) ✅
• Apps built in React/Next.js (already done)
• UI pulls data via API routes
• Handles free vs premium feature gating

2. Authentication & User Management
• Firebase Auth (email, Google, Apple, social logins)
• Role-based access:
  - Free (limited cards/features)
  - Premium (unlimited profiles & full feature set)
• Secure session tokens → used on every request

3. Database - Firestore (NoSQL)
• Collections:
  - Users → profile info, auth ID, subscription tier, referral credits
  - Referrals → who referred who, payout/bonus days earned
  - Cards Data → static card lookups (Birth Card map, yearly forecasts, planetary CSVs)

4. Payments & Subscriptions - Stripe Integration
• Subscription tiers:
  - $22.22 → 1 app
  - $33.33 → 2 apps
  - $44.44 → all 3 apps
• Trial logic: $1 for 30 days (auto-converts to regular plan)
• Webhooks (Node.js API routes or Firebase Functions)

5. Referral System
• Track invites → $5 Stripe credit when a referred user continues after trial

6. Business Logic Layer (API Routes)
• Card Lookup API: User enters DOB → returns Birth Card + Forecast cards
• Composite Lookup API (Love Cheat Code): Parent Card + Child Card → returns compatibility composite
• Profiles API: Pulls card descriptions, green/red flags, activities, etc.

7. Storage
• Firebase Storage / GCP Bucket / AWS S3 for:
  - Card images (52 cards + Joker, PNG/SVG)
  - JSON files (card activities, profiles, composites)

8. Notifications
• Email only (SendGrid or Firebase email extension)
• Welcome emails, payment confirmations, referral reward emails

9. Security
• HTTPS enforced
• Firestore security rules: users can only read/write their own profile
• Secure environment variables (.env) for API keys

10. Analytics
• Mixpanel or Google Analytics → user behavior
• Stripe Dashboard → revenue, churn, referrals
