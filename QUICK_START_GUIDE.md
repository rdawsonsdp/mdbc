# Vector Database Quick Start Guide

## üìä Your Multi-App Ecosystem

| App | Focus | Books Needed |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| **MDBC** (Million Dollar Birth Card) | Business & Entrepreneurship | Business strategy, timing, entrepreneurship |
| **LCC** (Love Cheat Code) | Dating & Relationships | Compatibility, dating, communication |
| **DYK** (Decode Your Kid) | Parenting | Child development, parenting strategies |

**All 3 apps share:** Card profiles, planetary periods, fundamentals

---

## ‚ö° Quick Implementation (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Organize Books (30 minutes)

```bash
# Create folder structure
mkdir -p data/books/shared
mkdir -p data/books/mdbc  
mkdir -p data/books/lcc
mkdir -p data/books/dyk

# Download from Google Drive and organize:
# shared/  ‚Üí Card profiles, fundamentals (used by all apps)
# mdbc/    ‚Üí Business strategy books
# lcc/     ‚Üí Relationship books
# dyk/     ‚Üí Parenting books
```

### Step 2: Create Shared Vector Store (2 hours)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install openai@latest

# Add API key to .env.local
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" >> .env.local

# Create shared Vector Store (uploads all books)
node scripts/2-setup-multi-app-vector-store.js

# Output: Vector Store ID (one for all apps!)
```

### Step 3: Create App-Specific Assistants (30 minutes)

```bash
# Creates 3 assistants (MDBC, LCC, DYK)
# All use the SAME Vector Store
node scripts/3-create-multi-app-assistants.js

# Output: 3 Assistant IDs (one per app)
```

**Total Time: ~3 hours**

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### Shared Vector Store (RECOMMENDED)

```
Storage:  $0.30/month (all 3 apps combined!)
API:      $180/month (10K queries)
Total:    $210/month

Per app:  $70/month

Cost optimization: Use GPT-3.5-turbo ‚Üí $60-80/month total
```

### Separate Vector Stores (NOT recommended)

```
Storage:  $0.90/month (3 separate stores)
API:      $180/month (10K queries)
Total:    $270/month

Waste:    $60/month extra (shared books stored 3x!)
```

**Savings with shared approach: $60/month (22%)**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
[Google Drive Books]
       ‚Üì
[ONE Shared Vector Store]
       ‚Üì
[3 Specialized Assistants]
  ‚Üì       ‚Üì        ‚Üì
MDBC    LCC      DYK
(Business) (Love) (Parenting)
```

**Key Insight:** Same question, same card, different context!

Example: "What are my strengths?"
- MDBC ‚Üí "Your entrepreneurial strengths are..."
- LCC ‚Üí "Your relationship strengths are..."  
- DYK ‚Üí "Your parenting strengths are..."

## üìù Environment Variables

### MDBC App (.env.local)
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_mdbc123...
```

### LCC App (.env.local)
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_lcc456...
```

### DYK App (.env.local)
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_dyk789...
```

**Same API key, different Assistant IDs!**

## üöÄ Deployment Sequence

### Week 1: MDBC
1. Set up shared Vector Store
2. Upload MDBC + shared books
3. Create MDBC Assistant
4. Deploy MDBC app
5. Test and gather feedback

### Week 2: LCC
1. Upload LCC books (to existing Vector Store)
2. Create LCC Assistant
3. Deploy LCC app
4. Verify shared books work correctly

### Week 3: DYK
1. Upload DYK books (to existing Vector Store)
2. Create DYK Assistant
3. Deploy DYK app
4. Complete ecosystem!

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Books not uploading
```bash
# Check file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT only)
# Max 512MB per file
# Check API key permissions
```

### Issue: No citations in responses
```bash
# Verify Vector Store linked to Assistant
# Check files are "completed" status
# Try more specific queries
```

### Issue: Wrong app context
```bash
# Verify correct Assistant ID in .env
# Check Assistant instructions
# Review book organization
```
