---

## Backend Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. **Frontend (User Facing Layer)** ✅
- Apps built in React/Next.js (already done)
- UI pulls data via API routes
- Handles free vs premium feature gating

#### 2. **Authentication & User Management**
- Firebase Auth (email, Google, Apple, social logins)
- Role-based access:
  - Free (limited cards/features)
  - Premium (unlimited profiles & full feature set)
- Secure session tokens → used on every request

#### 3. **Database - Firestore (NoSQL)**
- Collections:
  - Users → profile info, auth ID, subscription tier, referral credits
  - Referrals → who referred who, payout/bonus days earned
  - Cards Data → static card lookups (Birth Card map, yearly forecasts, planetary CSVs)

#### 4. **Payments & Subscriptions - Stripe Integration**
- Subscription tiers:
  - $22.22 → 1 app
  - $33.33 → 2 apps
  - $44.44 → all 3 apps
- Trial logic: $1 for 30 days (auto-converts to regular plan)
- Webhooks (Node.js API routes or Firebase Functions)

#### 5. **Referral System**
- Track invites → $5 Stripe credit when a referred user continues after trial

#### 6. **Business Logic Layer (API Routes)**
- Card Lookup API: User enters DOB → returns Birth Card + Forecast cards
- Composite Lookup API (Love Cheat Code): Parent Card + Child Card → returns compatibility composite
- Profiles API: Pulls card descriptions, green/red flags, activities, etc.

#### 7. **Storage**
- Firebase Storage / GCP Bucket / AWS S3 for:
  - Card images (52 cards + Joker, PNG/SVG)
  - JSON files (card activities, profiles, composites)

#### 8. **Notifications**
- Email only (SendGrid or Firebase email extension)
- Welcome emails, payment confirmations, referral reward emails

#### 9. **Security**
- HTTPS enforced
- Firestore security rules: users can only read/write their own profile
- Secure environment variables (.env) for API keys

#### 10. **Analytics**
- Mixpanel or Google Analytics → user behavior
- Stripe Dashboard → revenue, churn, referrals
